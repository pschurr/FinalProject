Gameplay Notes/Logic:

-Player will have up to 5 party members and enemy will have up to 5 party 
members
-Teams will alternate turns, in which each member of a given team can move to a
different location and then attack
-Type of character determines how far they can move, "faster" characters can 
move further but will have less attack or defense power
-Every 5th turn, "Mortal Kombat" mode may activate, allowing two characters to 
fight each other (player controls member of own party)
-Characters must be within a certain distance of another character to attack
-Upon defeating an enemy, players will gain experience and/or gold
-Player's team will try to defend a castle or claim enemy's castle by 
surrounding the castle and defeating a certain number of enemy characters
-Player wins by claiming enemy castle, and loses if all of their party is 
defeated

Player classes:
-3 types of characters: Knight(melee), Archer(ranged), Mage(magic)
-Archers can attack from further away (greater range) but are less capable
defenders
-Mages can cast spells that change own/enemy's stats, can do damage or heal
self or allies
